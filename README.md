# Academic Success Prediction

This repository explores **machine learning approaches for predicting student academic success, dropout, or failure** using the [UCI "Predict Students Dropout and Academic Success" dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Predict+Students+Dropout+and+Academic+Success).

## Project Overview
The goal is to build and evaluate classification models that help identify patterns in student performance and predict their academic outcomes. This can provide valuable insights for early intervention and improving retention rates.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature encoding using `.map()` for categorical targets
- Implementation of classification models (e.g., KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook



## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tajerome/Academic-Success.git
   cd Academic-Success

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
